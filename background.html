                    Artificial Intelligence is a department well known for taking place in multiple job sectors like
                    health science, business, and engineering. Artificial Intelligence and automation are the two
                    most wanted facilities for a variety of jobs. Several researchers have conducted research and wrote
                    resources like books and journal articles on artificial intelligence and its role in replacing
                    the human workforce. <br> <br>
                    Some researchers conducted studies and summarised that AI will replace the human
                    workforce. 30% of the world’s current human labour will be replaced by intelligent agents and
                    robots by 2030. This is because artificial intelligence and automation save up lots of time and
                    money and increase efficiency.

                    In the presence of AI, companies will be able to fill up empty positions in a company easily by analysing incoming applications of job applicants and evaluating their skills, knowledge and experience to select the best worker among the applicants in a short period. In the future, people must be prepared for the loss of 99% of jobs due to
                    artificial intelligence.

                    On the other hand, researchers conducted studies and concluded that AI will not
                    replace the human workforce in some job fields due to specific reasons depending on the field.
                    Artificial intelligence will not replace interventional radiologists because it is dangerous.
                    Radiologists will handle some tasks which machines are unable to do, such as decision making.

                    K. E. Karches mentioned that experts in the medical field have argued to go against the
                    incorporation of artificial intelligence in medical care. This is because it will bring up the
                    possibility of “iDoctor”, which will replace all the physicians around the world. Machines will not
                    be able to create an understanding between patients and doctors.

                    However, there are researchers who concluded that artificial intelligence will not
                    replace the human workforce, instead, they will work together to form a better future.
                    This is because AI has a certain specialisation that humans do not have while humans have
                    specialisations and talents which AI and automation will never be able to execute successfully.

                    Therefore, they should work together to achieve their objective in a short time and simple way. For
                    instance,
                    voice transcription space has a voice-to-text technology which plays a major role for the people
                    with
                    hearing and speaking inability.
                    <br> <br>
                    However, it is not reliable because accent, speed, dictation,
                    tone of speech, and background noise may affect the transcription. So, the most effective way is to
                    use the AI facility, then approach the humans for help to verify accuracy and fix any errors.
                    Based on the literature review, artificial intelligence equally brings harm and good, but it
                    depends on the job field involved. Different job field has different ways of doing tasks. For
                    example, the medical field requires human workforce for better understanding between doctors and
                    patients. IT fields require more time and energy-saving techniques to complete the given tasks
                    shortly and easily.
