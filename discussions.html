            <p> Artificial Intelligence brings multiple advantages to humans in multiple areas. It reduces human errors,
                increasing the chance of reaching accuracy. AI can do risky things which may endanger humans, like
                defusing bombs. It is available for 24/7 and it also helps humans with repetitive jobs like document
                verification in banks as humans will get very bored of repeating the same tasks every day. Digital
                assistance like Chatbots saves the need for
                human resources as artificial intelligence and automation are handling them.
                <br>
                AI takes decisions faster compared to humans who analyse factors both emotionally and practically. When
                humans play Chess games in Windows, it is impossible to beat the system in hard mode due to the AI
                behind the game. AI also has
                daily applications like Apple’s Siri and Google’s Alexa which simplifies a human’s daily routine like
                searching for information and replying to messages.
            </p>

        <div class="disc-container">
            <p>However, artificial intelligence also brings disadvantages like high costs of creation for software
                and hardware of complex machines. They make humans lazy as the inventions are automating a majority
                of human’s work. AI increases the unemployment rate as they are replacing the minimum qualified
                individuals with AI robots.
                They are lacking high order thinking skills because they work only based on their algorithms
                developed by humans.
                <br> Nevertheless, human workforce brings a lot of advantages. It relieves the burden of multiple
                business companies because human workforce departments will get involved in time-consuming tasks
                which will enable the higher position workers to focus on the big-picture items like gaining market
                share. Other than that, the human workforce helps to maintain compliance as they possess the
                expertise in areas such as discriminatory laws, compensation laws.
                <br> The human workforce also has disadvantages like relinquishing control regarding how the
                business operates. This can cause the employees to end up making decisions that are not in the
                organization’s
                best interests.
                <br> The human workforce also increases the time and money usage. This is because a
                business will have to take some time to hire the staff for the department and they represent a
                significant cost to the business depending on how large the human workforce department is.
                <br><br> Based on the objective of the report, it is concluded that artificial intelligence will not
                replace
                the human workforce because they will both function together with each other. Humans will not be
                able to depend on artificial intelligence or human workforce completely as they both have their
                weaknesses. However, when both are combined, it increases perfection in the task given and they will
                be able to complete an activity given at the best quality in minimum time using minimal resources.
                <br> For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, humans were unable to control the spread of the
                disease due to the risk of them getting infected and the low number of human workforces. So,
                artificial intelligence has been brought in to work together with the human workforce to reduce the
                spread of the disease. Temperature checking and disease testing were some of the activities where
                both the human workforce and artificial intelligence were actively involved.</p>
