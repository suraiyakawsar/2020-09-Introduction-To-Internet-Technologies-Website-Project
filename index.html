                    <h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VS THE WORKFORCE</h2>
                    <p> Our aim is to research more into how AI is affecting the human workforce, since AI is commonly seen as the primary cause of such a serious increase in unemployment in our society, which is why we want to shed light on how we can solve this problem and bridge the gap between humans and robots. Some critical strategies are being implemented to solve these emerging problems that could be caused by AI and rapid technological change in the workplace, such as overhauling our entire education system, and bridging the supply-demand gap as well.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>“Robots are not going to replace humans, they are going to make their jobs much more humane.
                        Difficult, demeaning, demanding, dangerous, dull – these are the jobs robots will be taking." -

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
                    <h3>1. What is the difference between artificial intelligence and robotics?</h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that creates machines that are capable of problem-solving and learning similarly to humans. The branch of engineering/technology focused on constructing and operating robots is called robotics.</p>
                    <h3>2. Is automation and AI similar?</h3>
                    <p>AI mimics human intelligence decisions and actions, while automation focuses on streamlining repetitive, instructive tasks. However, majority of machine creations must involve a combination of both.</p>
                    <h3>3. Is there a future for AI and automation in terms of job?</h3>
                    <p>AI is currently getting wider around the world and majority of the new jobs found are related to AI and automation. They are still growing wider to solve numerous issues and make things easier for humans.
